# About

Debian 11 (Bullseye) box with NFS share enabled.
Note that if you have an NFS server or config file around then Vagrant will default to using NFS, however its default options may be incompatible with your server, hence the need to specify the sync folder method details.

The box used is the official one from the Debian project. The `generic` box also works and is from Lavabit.
